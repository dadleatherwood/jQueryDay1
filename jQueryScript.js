//$ pretty much stands for jQuery, which is a function

//to create a jQuery document, we start our script file with the following, and all your jquery code will be placed within the callback function

//it will invoke the function once the document is ready and loaded, which is what the ready() function does

$(document).ready(function(){
  
})
